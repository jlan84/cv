        <li>
            <a href="https://github.com/jlan84/Contract-Identification-and-Filtration">Contract Identification and Filtration</a>
            <strong>
                | Web Scraping, Data Cleaning, OCR, AWS, EC2, Pipelining,
                NLP, Naïve Bayes, NMF, OOP
            </strong>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Project involved developing a method to identify contract
                    type, identify changes made in a contract, and filter a
                    contract for content
                </li>
                <li>
                    Utilized web scraping techniques along with OCR and AWS to
                    develop a contract database
                </li>
                <li>
                    The model was 90% accurate when predicting the contract
                    classification from 6 different classes and was generated
                    using NLP and Naïve Bayes
                </li>

                | Data Cleaning, Pandas, Matplotlib, EDA, Data Visualization
            </strong>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Worked with the Colorado Hispanic Chamber of Commerce to
                    identify which industry’s employees were at higher risk of
                    contracting COVID-19
                </li>
                <li>
                    This project required an intense amount of data cleaning
                    in order to produce a usable set of data
                </li>
            </ul>

                Fraud Detection
            </a>
            <strong>
                | Data Pipelining, MongoDB, OOP, Data Cleaning, NLP,
                Random Forest, Flask, BeautifulSoup
            </strong>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Project involved developing a method for detecting
                    fraudulent venues
                </li>
                <li>
                    Utilized BeatifulSoup, MongoDB, and Pandas to clean and
                    organize the data
                </li>
                <li>
                    Utilized a combination of models to achieve an F1 score of
                    nearly 94% predicting fraud
                </li>
                <li>
                    Utilized Flask to generate a web application that can
                    detect fraud from incoming data
                </li>
